# to-do-app #
This is part 2 of the the To-Do-App project. This exercise introcuded me to DOM events. 

In this project I created a simple to do app where I: 

> * Undertood DOM Events and how they enable interactive web pages and web apps
> * Analyze and determine which Events are most appropiate for the current situation
> * Create and use custom Even Listeners and methods
> * Recognize and use common ES6 features like cont, let, and arrow functions
> * Understand the concepts of state and UI
> * Organize code in a more logical manner
